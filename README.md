# hello-world
Hello, I am James. I am utilizing discipline, open-source education, and motivation to learn code. I am working towards landing my first jr. developer job. I am currently Attending college at Lorain County Community College, working a full-time job in warehouse, and putting in a lot of effort into learning how to code. I aspire to land my first jr. developer job once I put enough time and effort into learning the fundamentals of coding. I currently Utilize freecodecamp.org for my coding curriculum.  Any advice or recommendations is always welcome. Feel free to check out my twitter page for updates on my status. I am looking forward to my future as well as the success this world can bring us all. Thank you for taking the time to read this. ~ James R. Kalvitz Jr.
